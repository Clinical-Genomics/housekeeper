### Store, tag, fetch, and archive files with ease ðŸ—ƒ

**Housekeeper** is a tool that aims to provide:

- a backend for storing versioned bundles of files
- different interfaces (Python, CLI, REST) for fetching files based on tags
- a way to backup and retrieve bundles from long-term storage

### Todo

- [ ] re-implement the archive/encryption interface [@ingkebil]
- [ ] handle clean up of expired bundles [@robinandeer]
- [ ] expand the CLI with `get` command etc. [@robinandeer]

### Command line interface

#### Config file

Housekeeper supports a very simple YAML config. The following options are supported:

```yaml
---
database: mysql+pymysql://userName:passWord@domain.com/database
root: /path/to/root/dir
```

The `root` option is used to store files within the Housekeeper context.

#### Command: `init`

Setup (or reset) the database. It will simply setup all the tables in the database. You can reset an existing database by using the `--reset` option.

```bash
housekeeper --database "sqlite:///hk.sqlite3" init
Success! New tables: bundle, file, file_tag_link, tag, version
```

#### Command: `include`

Include (hard-link) all files of an existing bundle version into Housekeeper and the `root` path.

```bash
housekeeper myBundle
```

This will only work if the bundle only has a single version which can be "imported". If you want to import a specific version of a bundle you can use the `--version` option.

#### Command: `delete files`

Delete files that are not on disk anymore like his:
`housekeeper delete files --tag fastq --notondisk`

Remove all bam files before a certain date:
`housekeeper delete files --tag bam --before 2017-06-15`

Remove fastq files from a flowcell:
`housekeeper delete files --tag fastq --tag H0HKKALXX`

It'll always ask for confirmation, unless you add --yes:
`housekeeper delete files --bundle sillyfish --yes`

If you do not provide a --tag or --bundle, essentially deleting everything, the function will not let you do that.
